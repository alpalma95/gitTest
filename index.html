    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>I wouldn't like this to be wrapped inside a container tbh...</p>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Hi there</h1>
      <p>Alright so I'm putting this inside a container as well</p>
      <p>
        I know that this is mistake but I'm editing from another branch this
        thing that should be yours... I wonder what will happen if you happen to
        be working on something here.

        <strong>Late edit:</strong>Alright so I see you got a conflict and yet
        accepted both changes. Cool ðŸ™‚
      </p>
      <h2>
        This is another h2. I'm sure the other person should be working on the
        block below, so this should not cause any conflict. I will pull any
        possible changes from main before pushing
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Hi there from anotherBranch</h2>
      <p>
        It is a good idea to put this inside a container. The leader should be
        working on the main branch I think.
